# Tries
An Android game which uses a Trie data structure to load a dictionary into.
Dictionary loading happens when app launches. Building the Trie does take a while.
Search is very efficient though.

Presents a 5x5 grid of icons with letters on them.
After pressing a finger down, it collects letters you swipe over, and then checks the trie to see if the collected letters make a valid word. If they do, the letters are replaced with new letters.
